AstroTarot beta is an astrophysics-themed french tarot card deck developped by PhD students from the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris (IAP).
It is an open source draft with many components generated by AI (ChatGPT), as opposed to the final version which will be hand drawn by an artist (Luna Belkadi).
The four families (galaxies, stars, telescopes and black holes), have as background for the numbered cards astrophotographical pictures (see credits), and for honours: divinities for Jacks (V), scientists for Knights (C) and Queens (D), and astrophysical objects for Kings (R).
The trump cards represent astrophysical processes, and can be used for taromancy (see Tarot Reading card).
To learn how to play french tarot, there is a Tarot Rules card.
